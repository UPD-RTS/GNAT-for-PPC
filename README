Porting to PPC of GNAT-FOR-LEON /ORK+ RTOS from Universitad Politecnica de Madrid
(http://www.dit.upm.es/~ork/index.html/)
The actual target is a PPC750-like system simulator but runs as well on top of
the qemu PPC (prep) model.

############### Tool chain #####################################################
The toolchain is not fully integrated and some manual modifications need to be applied.
The only relevant modifcations in the toolchain are in the Makefile.fpu
for which a symbolic link should be defined (Makefile -> Makefile.fpu).
Just make sure that Makefile-fpu paths are not broken.

This repo includes only those files in gcc that have been modified.


################ Building an application ###################################################

Need to include some compilation flags (as they have not been made implicit in the driver yet)

/path/to/powerpc-elf-gnatmake file.adb -f -v -msim -largs -nostartfiles boot.o -Xlinker -lc -t -M -T/path/to/gnatforleon-2.3.0-src/src/powerpc.ld

where boot.o is the outcome of compiling boot.S

/path/to/powerpc-elf-gcc -c boot.S 

To do so header msr.h and hid0.h should be visible (they are located in [...]gcc/ada).
I suggest to cpoy them to the build folder (until we make it fully automated).
